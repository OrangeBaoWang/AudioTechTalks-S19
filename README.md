## Series Overview
We will cover a range of audio topics and look at the theory behind them using practical examples and demonstrations. The material will be presented for a general audience and will focus on topics such as digital audio, audio signal processing, and artificial intelligence. Each tutorial session will run around an hour and is meant to encourage discussion and questions.
